This is the language reference for the Crystal programming language.

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal).
Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method parameters.
Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
Compile to efficient native code.
